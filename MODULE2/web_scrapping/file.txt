console.logSuppose you want some information from a website? 
Let’s say a paragraph on Donald Trump! What do you do? Well, you can copy 
and paste the information from Wikipedia to your own file. But what if you want to get
 large amounts of information from a website as quickly as possible? Such as large amounts 
 of data from a website to train a Machine Learning algorithm? In such a situation, copying 
 and pasting will not work! And that’s when you’ll need to use Web Scraping.
